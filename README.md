# MJava-Compiler

A compiler for Mini-Java

# Build

You can use `CMake` to build this project. Of course, the project is very simple, you can also compile programs directly from the command line.

If you use `CMake`, run

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
mingw32-make install
```

I use `MinGW Makefiles` here, but you can use others.
